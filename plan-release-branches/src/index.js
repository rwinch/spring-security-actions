 * Decides what the push of an embargoed branch builds, from the branch that was pushed

 *
 *   release           true: there is something to build. (The workflow ends the run before it
 *                     builds a hotfix of a .0 version whose next release is a milestone or a
 *                     release candidate, which have no hotfix.)

 *   kind              frozen, active or lts
 *   baseVersion       the snapshot version that the release version is worked out from: the
 *                     version of the frozen branch (7.0.1-SNAPSHOT), or the hotfix version
 *                     of an active one (7.0.1.1-SNAPSHOT)
 *   hotfix            true for an active embargoed branch: a hotfix is built, and hotfix versions
 *                     of the dependencies are preferred
 *   hotfixOf          for a hotfix, the release branch that it fixes and is built on:
 *                     release/7.0.1 for 7.0.1-SNAPSHOT. Empty for a frozen embargoed branch
 *   hotfixOfVersion   the version of that release: 7.0.1. Empty for a frozen embargoed branch
 *   deploymentDestination
 *                     where the release is deployed to, as the release train names it:
 *                     maven-central for a frozen embargoed branch, spring-enterprise for an
 *                     active one (a hotfix is commercial) or a long-term support one
 *   frozenBranch      for an active embargoed branch, the frozen embargoed branch of the same
 *                     generation, which a hotfix is only built for if the active one differs
 *                     from it: embargoed/frozen/7.0.x for embargoed/active/7.0.x. Empty for a
 *                     frozen embargoed branch
 *   snapshotBranch    the branch of the snapshot that the release branch is built on (active)
 *                     or that is thrown away (frozen): embargoed/7.0.1-INTERNAL-SNAPSHOT,
 *                     embargoed/7.0.1.1-SNAPSHOT
 *   snapshotVersion   the version of that branch: 7.0.1-INTERNAL-SNAPSHOT, 7.0.1.1-SNAPSHOT.
 *                     A snapshot never carries a milestone or a release candidate, so it is the
 *                     version of the branch with -SNAPSHOT replaced, and not the release.
 *                     A hotfix never has an internal snapshot
