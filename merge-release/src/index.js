/**
 * Merges the release that a hotfix fixes into the branch that is checked out, so that the
 * hotfix is based on the release: the release plus the fixes of the active disclosure.
 *
 * The merge is a merge commit (Merge release/7.0.1 into disclosure/7.0.1.1-SNAPSHOT), signed
 * off with the identity that git is set up with, even if the release could be fast forwarded
 * to. It is made from the branch of the remote (origin/release/7.0.1), as it was when the
 * repository was checked out.
 *
 * - If the release does not exist (the frozen disclosure has not been pushed yet), it is a
 *   warning and nothing is merged: the hotfix is built from the active disclosure alone.
 * - If the release is in the branch already, there is nothing to merge.
 * - If both sides changed the same lines, the side of the branch that is checked out wins
 *   (-X ours): the active disclosure is the one that has the fixes. The files that both
 *   sides changed are said in a notice, so that is not silent. A conflict that cannot be
 *   resolved that way (a file that one side deleted and the other changed, a binary file)
 *   fails, and the merge is undone.
 *
 * It returns merged: "true", "false" (there is no such release) or "up-to-date".
