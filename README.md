# spring-security-actions

GitHub Actions of the Spring Security projects. Every action is in a directory of its own, with its own `README.md` that documents its inputs, outputs and secrets.

Use one with `uses: spring-io/spring-security-actions/<action>@<ref>`.

## The actions of the release automation

They are written in JavaScript (Node 24), and every one of them is **self contained**: it has its own `package.json` and lock file, its own sources in `src/`, its own tests in `test/` (with the fake of GitHub and the fixtures that they need), and its own `dist/`, the bundle that GitHub runs. Nothing is shared between them, so one can be changed, updated and used without the others. Each one can be run locally too: see its README.

| Action | What it does |
|---|---|
| [`apply-commercial-license`](apply-commercial-license/README.md) | Changes a repository to the commercial license: headers and `LICENSE.txt`, for a hotfix. |
| [`check-not-ready`](check-not-ready/README.md) | Fails if the release train has the release as ready already. |
| [`compare-branches`](compare-branches/README.md) | Whether a branch has changes that another branch lacks: a hotfix is only built for an active embargoed branch that differs from the frozen one. |
| [`compute-release-version`](compute-release-version/README.md) | The release version of a snapshot version, and its due date, from the milestones of a repository. |
| [`ensure-dependency-issues`](ensure-dependency-issues/README.md) | An issue for every dependency update, in a milestone. It makes the ones that are missing. |
| [`git-identity`](git-identity/README.md) | Sets who commits: `github-actions[bot]` by default. |
| [`load-train`](load-train/README.md) | Reads the release train of a date. |
| [`map-train-versions`](map-train-versions/README.md) | Which versions of a version catalog the release train asks to change, and to what. |
| [`merge-release`](merge-release/README.md) | Merges the release into the branch of its hotfix. |
| [`name-repositories`](name-repositories/README.md) | The project and its OSS repository, from the commercial repository. |
| [`plan-release-branches`](plan-release-branches/README.md) | What the push of an embargoed branch builds. |
| [`push-branches`](push-branches/README.md) | Pushes branches at once or none, and summarizes them. |
| [`set-version`](set-version/README.md) | Sets the version of `gradle.properties`, in a commit of its own. |
| [`start-branch`](start-branch/README.md) | Starts (or resets) a branch at a commit or a branch. |
| [`update-versions`](update-versions/README.md) | Changes the versions of a version catalog, with one commit for each. |

## The workflow of the release automation

[`release-branches.yml`](.github/workflows/release-branches.yml) is a reusable workflow that builds `release/<version>` and the snapshot branches on a push to an embargoed branch, with the actions above and nothing else (every step is an action). [docs/release-branches.md](docs/release-branches.md) is the guide: what it builds, how to call it, the secret and the tokens it needs, and what to do when it fails.

## Working on an action

```shell
cd <action>
npm ci
npm test            # no network and no token
npm run build       # formats, and bundles src/ into dist/: commit both
```

`dist/` is committed, because GitHub runs it with no `npm install`, and CI fails if it is not the build of `src/`. Dependabot updates the dependencies of every action, and the actions that these use.

## Releasing a change of an action

The release workflow calls the actions of this repository at a commit, so a change of an action reaches the callers in three steps: merge the change, change the commit in every `uses:` of `.github/workflows/release-branches.yml` to the commit of the merge (CI checks that they are commits of this repository), and tag the commit of that second change. Callers of the workflow then pin the tag's commit.
