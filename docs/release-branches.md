# The release automation

A push to an embargoed branch of the commercial repository builds the branches of its release, with no one doing it by hand. This is the guide to it: what it builds, what it needs, how to give it the secrets that it needs, and what to do when it fails.

## What a push builds

The reusable workflow [`release-branches.yml`](../.github/workflows/release-branches.yml) of this repository, and the actions that it uses (each is a directory of this repository, with a README). The project calls it for a push to `embargoed/frozen/**`, `embargoed/active/**` or `embargoed/lts/**`. It builds the branches of the release again from the pushed commit, every time, and pushes them once, both or none, forced. Nobody commits to them.

A push to a snapshot branch that it built (`embargoed/*-SNAPSHOT`) is for the project to publish: the pushes are made with `RELEASE_AUTOMATION_TOKEN`, so they run the workflows of the project.

|  | A frozen embargoed branch, `embargoed/frozen/7.0.x` (`7.0.1-SNAPSHOT`) | An active embargoed branch, `embargoed/active/7.0.x` (`7.0.1-SNAPSHOT`) |
|---|---|---|
| The release | `release/7.0.1`, from the pushed commit. For a `.0` version (`7.1.0-SNAPSHOT`) the release is the next milestone: `release/7.1.0-RC1` | `release/7.0.1.1`, **from the snapshot branch**: it is the hotfix of `7.0.1` |
| The commits of the release | one for each dependency that the release train asks for, with its issue (`Closes gh-123`), and then `Release 7.0.1` | one for each dependency that has a hotfix version in the train, with its issue in the commercial repository (the others keep the version that the release has), and then `Release 7.0.1.1` |
| The snapshot branch | `embargoed/7.0.1-INTERNAL-SNAPSHOT`: its version, and an internal snapshot of every dependency that has joined the train (no issues). Thrown away when the release is done | `embargoed/7.0.1.1-SNAPSHOT`: `release/7.0.1` merged in first, then the commercial license and the Broadcom headers, its version, and a snapshot of every dependency that has a hotfix version in the train (no issues) |
| Not built | a hotfix (a frozen embargoed branch has none) | nothing at all for a version that ends with `.0` (it is not a patch release, so it has no hotfix), and nothing at all for an active embargoed branch that has no changes that the frozen one of its generation lacks (a notice says so) |

### OSS support must last until the release is public

A frozen or active embargoed branch is for a generation that is OSS when its release is made public, on the date of its train. The workflow reads the generation (`7.0.x`) from the Spring projects API (`https://api.spring.io/projects/spring-security/generations`) in the plan job, and fails with **OSS support of 7.0.x ended** if its `ossSupportEndDate` is before that date (the last day counts). Once a generation is commercial, replace its frozen and active branches with one `embargoed/lts/<generation>` branch. A long-term support branch is not checked.

### A long-term support embargoed branch

`embargoed/lts/<generation>` (`embargoed/lts/5.8.x`, `5.8.30-SNAPSHOT`) is commercial: it is merged into other long-term support branches only, and releases its own version. A push builds only `release/5.8.30`, from the pushed commit, with **no snapshot branch** and no internal snapshot. The commits of the release are the ones of a frozen branch (an issue for each dependency that the release train asks for, and then `Release 5.8.30`), but the milestone `5.8.30` and the issues are in the **commercial repository**, since there is no OSS release. It is deployed to `spring-enterprise`.

Its train is found as for a release: the milestone `5.8.30` is due on the date of the train, `2026-11-19` for the train `2026.11.19`. The due date of its milestone is not changed. The release joins the train with the destination `spring-enterprise`, and takes the release versions of the train (it prefers no hotfix versions of the dependencies).

### The hotfix is built on the release

A hotfix is the release plus the fixes of the active embargoed branch, so the snapshot branch of a hotfix starts with `release/7.0.1` **merged in** (a merge commit, `Merge release/7.0.1 into embargoed/7.0.1.1-SNAPSHOT`), and the release of the hotfix is built on that snapshot. Both have the release in their history. The action `merge-release` does it.

- **The active embargoed branch has nothing that the frozen one lacks**: a hotfix is the fixes of the active embargoed branch on the release, so with no fixes there is no hotfix. The workflow compares the active branch with the frozen one of its generation (`embargoed/frozen/7.0.x` for `embargoed/active/7.0.x`), the changes of the active branch since their merge base, as `git diff frozen...active` gives them (the action `compare-branches`). The merge of the frozen branch into the active one has no changes of its own, so right after the merge forward there is nothing to build: the run succeeds, with the notice **Nothing to build**, and builds neither the snapshot branch nor `release/7.0.1.1`. This is decided first, before the milestone of the hotfix is looked for, so it needs no milestone then. If the frozen branch does not exist, there is nothing to compare with: the hotfix is built, with the notice **No frozen embargoed branch**.
- **The release does not exist yet** (the frozen embargoed branch has not been pushed, so nothing built it): the run warns (**No release to build the hotfix on**), and the hotfix is built from the active embargoed branch alone. It is built on the release the next time that the active embargoed branch is pushed after the release exists, for example when the frozen embargoed branch is merged into it. A hotfix that was built before has an issue for every dependency, and the dependencies that have no hotfix do not need theirs any more: they stay open, and are closed by hand.
- **Both sides changed the same lines**: the side of the active embargoed branch is kept, and a notice (**Changed on both sides**) says which files both changed. A conflict that cannot be settled like that, a file that one side deleted and the other changed, fails the run, and says to merge `release/7.0.1` into the active embargoed branch by hand (the merge forward), and push it.
- **The versions of the dependencies come with the release**, so a dependency that has no hotfix version in the release train is left at the version that the release has: no snapshot, no commit and no issue for it in the hotfix. The hotfix ends with the same versions as it would without the merge, and has an issue for each dependency that does have a hotfix.
- A release that is built again later is only picked up by the hotfix the next time that the active embargoed branch is pushed.

The **milestone** of the release, and the **issues** of its dependency updates, are in the **OSS repository** for a release, which is public. A hotfix is only released from the commercial repository, so its milestone (`7.0.1.1`, with a due date) and the issues of its dependency updates are in the **commercial repository**: a milestone in the OSS repository would tell everyone that there is a hotfix. The issue of a commit (`Closes gh-123`) is the one of the repository that has the milestone. The milestone is looked for first, in the plan job, and only if there is something to build. If it does not exist, the run succeeds with the notice **No milestone**, which names the milestone and the repository, and builds nothing. A milestone that exists without a due date is an error.

**Joining the train.** When the branches are pushed, the release joins the train by running the workflow `Join` of the release train repository on the train branch, for `release/7.0.1` (`maven-central` for a frozen embargoed branch, `spring-enterprise` for a hotfix, which is commercial). It joins only if the train exists and does not have the release yet, so a run that is made again does not join twice. The due date of the milestone of a hotfix is first set to `schedule.publication.commercial-general-availability` of its train (at noon UTC), if it is another or has none: the notice **Milestone due date** says so. The train of a hotfix is the one of its OSS equivalent, so the milestone of `7.0.1` in the OSS repository decides it. If that milestone does not exist, the run ends with the notice **No milestone**, as for any milestone, and builds nothing. To join after a milestone was fixed, run the workflow by hand on the embargoed branch (`workflow_dispatch`).

Which versions of the dependencies the release needs comes from the **release train**, a repository with a branch for each release date (`2026.11.19`) that has `release-versions.json` and `train.yml`. The branch is the date that the milestone of the release is due. For a hotfix it is the date that the OSS milestone of the release it fixes is due (`7.0.1` for `7.0.1.1`): the due date of the hotfix is when it is commercially available, after the train that builds it. If that train has not been created, the branches are built without the dependency updates. If the release is **ready** in the train, it is not changed: the run fails and says what to do.

## Calling it

The project has a workflow that the push of the embargoed branches triggers, and that calls this one. The trigger, the concurrency and the permissions are the project's: a called workflow cannot widen the permissions of the caller.

```yaml
name: release-branches

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - "embargoed/frozen/**"
      - "embargoed/active/**"
      - "embargoed/lts/**"
  # Run it by hand on an embargoed branch (for example after the due date of a milestone was set):
  # it builds the branches again from the head of the branch, and joins the train if it has not.
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read

# One run at a time for a branch, and the newest wins: a run only pushes at the very end,
# once, and what it creates on the way (the issues) is found again by the next run.
concurrency:
  group: release-branches-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  release-branches:
    uses: spring-io/spring-security-actions/.github/workflows/release-branches.yml@<ref>
    with:
      runs-on: ${{ vars.UBUNTU_RUNS_ON }}
      release-train-repository: ${{ vars.RELEASE_TRAIN_REPOSITORY }}
    secrets:
      RELEASE_AUTOMATION_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.RELEASE_AUTOMATION_TOKEN }}
```

| Input or secret | What it is |
|---|---|
| `runs-on` (input) | The runner of the jobs, a label. `ubuntu-latest` if it is not given, or empty. A private or internal repository should give the label of the runners of its organization (`ubuntu22-2-8`, in the runner group `spring-enterprise-builds`, for the commercial repositories, which keep it in the variable `UBUNTU_RUNS_ON`): GitHub-hosted runners are billed to the account, and GitHub refuses the jobs ("The job was not started because recent account payments have failed or your spending limit needs to be increased") if it cannot pay. |
| `release-train-repository` (input) | The release train repository, `owner/repo`. `spring-io/release-train` if it is not given, or empty. |
| `RELEASE_AUTOMATION_TOKEN` (secret) | The token below. A reusable workflow gets only the secrets that its caller gives it. |

`<ref>` is a tag or a commit of this repository. Pin a commit, as for any action that has access to a token. The workflow calls the actions of this repository at a commit that is written in it, each with a comment that names the tag. That commit is not the one of the workflow: it is the one that the actions were released at, so a caller that pins a commit of the workflow gets exactly the actions that it names.

The workflow runs from the pushed branch, so the workflow of the project must be on every embargoed branch: it comes with the merges forward.

## The secret, the variable, and the tokens

The caller needs one secret and one variable, which are settings of the **commercial repository**:

| Name | Kind | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `RELEASE_AUTOMATION_TOKEN` | secret | A token that can read the release train repository and run its workflow Join (Actions: Read and write), create issues in the OSS repository, read the milestones and create issues in the commercial repository (for a hotfix), and push to the commercial repository. See below. |
| `RELEASE_TRAIN_REPOSITORY` | variable | The release train repository, `owner/repo`. The caller gives it as the input `release-train-repository`. If it is not set, the release train is `spring-io/release-train`. |

Everything that can be done with the token of the workflow itself, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, is: the permissions of the workflow are `contents: read`, and it reads the milestones of the OSS repository, which is public. It cannot read the milestones of the commercial repository, which is private (that needs `issues: read`, and a called workflow cannot widen the permissions of its caller). `RELEASE_AUTOMATION_TOKEN` is only used where `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot:

| Step | Token | Why |
|---|---|---|
| the checkout, and the push of the branches | `RELEASE_AUTOMATION_TOKEN` | it writes to the commercial repository, and a push with it **runs workflows** (the workflows of the project that build the new branches and publish the snapshots). A push with `GITHUB_TOKEN` runs none. |
| `load-train` | `RELEASE_AUTOMATION_TOKEN` | the release train repository is private, and is another repository than this one. |
| `align-milestone` (a hotfix) | `RELEASE_AUTOMATION_TOKEN` | it writes a milestone of the commercial repository, which is this one, and `GITHUB_TOKEN` has `contents: read` only. |
| `join-train` | `RELEASE_AUTOMATION_TOKEN` | it runs a workflow of the release train repository, which is another repository than this one. |
| `ensure-dependency-issues` | `RELEASE_AUTOMATION_TOKEN` | the issues of a release are in the OSS repository, which is another repository than this one, and the issues of a hotfix are in this one, with its milestone. |
| `compute-release-version` (in the plan job) | `GITHUB_TOKEN` for a release, `RELEASE_AUTOMATION_TOKEN` for a hotfix | the milestones of a release are in the OSS repository, which is public. The milestone of a hotfix is in the commercial repository, which is private. |

### What the token needs

| Repository | What for | Fine-grained token | Classic token |
|---|---|---|---|
| the release train repository | read its branches and files, and run its workflow Join (`join-train`) | **Contents: Read-only** and **Actions: Read and write** | `repo` (it includes running workflows: no `workflow` scope is needed, that one is for changing workflow files) |
| the OSS repository | read its milestones, create and read its issues (for a release) | **Issues: Read and write** | `repo` (`public_repo` for a public repository) |
| the commercial repository | fetch it, and push the branches; read and set the due date of its milestones (a hotfix, `align-milestone`), create and read its issues (for a hotfix) | **Contents: Read and write** and **Issues: Read and write** (issues include milestones) | `repo` |

**A fine-grained token has one owner.** When the three repositories are in one account or one organization (as in the practice repositories), one fine-grained token with those three permissions does. When they are not (the real ones: the release train is in `spring-io`, the others in `spring-projects`), a fine-grained token cannot cover them, and you need a classic token, whose `repo` scope covers every repository that its user can access. Make it the token of a machine user that has the access that it needs, and not that of a person. The scopes are broad, and are the reason to keep the secret in the commercial repository only.

### Create a classic token

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens and choose **Generate new token (classic)**.
1. Give it a name (`release automation`) and an expiration, and select the scope `repo`. That is all: it reads and writes the contents, issues and milestones, and runs the workflow Join of the release train repository, of every repository that its user can access (the user needs write access to the commercial repository and the OSS repository issues, and access to the release train repository that lets it run workflows).
1. Generate it, and copy it. It is shown once.
1. For an organization that uses SAML single sign-on, choose **Configure SSO** next to the token and authorize the organizations of the repositories. Without it the token cannot read them.

### Create a fine-grained token

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens and choose **Generate new token**.
1. Choose the **resource owner** that owns the three repositories.
1. Choose **Only select repositories**, and select the release train repository, the OSS repository and the commercial repository.
1. Under **Repository permissions**, set **Contents** to **Read and write** (that is for the commercial repository, and reads the release train too), **Issues** to **Read and write** (the OSS repository, for a release, and the commercial repository, for a hotfix, with its milestones), and **Actions** to **Read and write** (runs the workflow Join of the release train repository). Metadata (read) is added by itself.
1. Generate it, and copy it.

### Store it

In the **commercial repository**, as a secret named `RELEASE_AUTOMATION_TOKEN`: **Settings**, **Secrets and variables**, **Actions**, **New repository secret**. Or with `gh`, which reads the secret from standard input, so that it is not in your history:

```shell
gh secret set RELEASE_AUTOMATION_TOKEN --repo your-organization/spring-security-commercial
gh variable set RELEASE_TRAIN_REPOSITORY --body spring-io/release-train --repo your-organization/spring-security-commercial
```


## When it fails

Every message says what went wrong. These are the usual ones:

| The run fails at | What to do |
|---|---|
| **Stop if the release is ready already** | The release is ready in the release train, and is not changed any more. To release the next version instead: set the version of `gradle.properties` to the next version in the OSS repository, and merge forward. |
| The run ends with the notice **No milestone** (`has no milestone 7.0.1`), and builds nothing | The milestone of the version does not exist. Create it, with a due date, in the OSS repository for a release, and in the commercial repository for a hotfix (`7.0.1.1`, an active embargoed branch: the notice names the commercial repository), and push again. |
| **Work out the release version**: `has no due date` | Set the due date of the milestone of a release. It is the date of the release train, `2026-11-19` for the train `2026.11.19`. A hotfix needs none: it is set from the train. |
| **Set the due date of the milestone of the hotfix**: `No commercial-general-availability` | The train has no `schedule.publication.commercial-general-availability`. Add it to the train, and run the workflow again. |
| **Check that the generation is still supported as OSS**: `OSS support of 7.0.x ended` | The generation is commercial by the date of the train. Replace `embargoed/frozen/7.0.x` and `embargoed/active/7.0.x` with `embargoed/lts/7.0.x`. |
| **Join the release train**: `Could not dispatch Join` | The token cannot run workflows of the release train repository: it needs Actions: Read and write on it (fine-grained), or `repo` (classic). |
| **Read the release train**: `404 ... cannot read it` | The token cannot read the release train repository, or `RELEASE_TRAIN_REPOSITORY` is wrong. A train that has not been created is not an error: the branches are built without the dependencies. |
| **Merge the release into the hotfix**: `could not be merged` | The active embargoed branch and the release changed a file in a way that the side of the active embargoed branch cannot settle. Merge `release/7.0.1` into the active embargoed branch by hand (the merge forward), push it, and the hotfix is built again. |
| **Merge the release into the hotfix**: warning `No release to build the hotfix on` | Not a failure: the release has not been built. Push the frozen embargoed branch, and push the active embargoed branch again. |
| **Make sure that there are issues**: `403` | The token cannot create issues in the repository that the message names, the OSS repository for a release and the commercial repository for a hotfix: see what it needs. |
| **Work out the versions of the dependencies**: `is newer than the ... of the train` | The version catalog has a newer version of a dependency than the release train. Something is out of order: look at it. The action does not downgrade. |
| **Set the version of the release**: `git does not know who commits` | git has no `user.name` and `user.email`. The workflow sets them, so this is a change to the workflow. |
| **Push the branches**: rejected | The token cannot push to the commercial repository, or a branch is protected against a forced push. Nobody commits to the branches that it builds, so they can be forced. |

A run that was cancelled by a newer push of the same branch is not a failure: the newer run builds the branches.

## What a project needs

- The version catalog, `gradle/libs.versions.toml`, names a version after the project of the release train that releases it (`spring-framework = "7.0.9"`), in its `[versions]` section, one on a line. A library refers to it with `version.ref`.
- The OSS repository has the milestones of the releases, with their due dates (at noon UTC). The commercial repository is named like it, with `-commercial`, has the embargoed branches, and has the milestones of the hotfixes (also with a due date, the date that the hotfix is commercially available).
- `apply-commercial-license` has the commercial license for a hotfix: give another with `license-file`. It changes the Apache headers (Java, AspectJ, Groovy, Kotlin, JavaScript, `.gradle`, `.properties`, `.xml` and `.tld`: `header-files`) to the Broadcom one with **one year for the project**, the oldest of its copyright (`year` gives another), rewrites `etc/checkstyle/header.txt` to match if the project has one, replaces the `LICENSE*` file of the root (`license-target`), and sets the license of the published POM to the Broadcom Foundation License. The last one needs a `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts` in the root: it applies `gradle/broadcom-license.gradle` from there, so it works whether or not the build reads `gradle/init.d` (`run-gradle` does, a plain `./gradlew` does not). Other copyright holders of a file are kept. Files that a `checkstyle-suppressions.xml` skips entirely (third-party code) are left alone.
- The actions are written for Node 24, as the actions of [spring-release-actions](https://github.com/spring-io/spring-release-actions) are. [The README](../README.md) says how to build and test them.
- GitHub is retiring the version `2022-11-28` of its API, which is the one that the actions use. It is a warning for now: see `ensure-dependency-issues`.
